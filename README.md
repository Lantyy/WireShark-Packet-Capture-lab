# This Project
This is a instructional step by step process to using the packet capture tool **Wireshark** for Defensive Security and Analyzing Network Traffic.

My purpose for this lab is to learn more about Analyzing Network Traffic and Security Monitoring.

# Virtual Machines / Tools
This lab consists of a Linux virtual machine and installing Wireshark onto it:

  ~ **Linux** ~ Used Wireshark on a Linux virtual machine.
  
  ~ **Wireshark** ~ Used to capture packets on a certain interface, then use various filters to observe website traffic.

# Lab Creation Steps
Installed and set up a Kali Linux virtual machine.

Captured and saved packets on a detected network using Wireshark.



Used a display filter to observe certain packet protocols.



Employed a display filter to detect a certain IP address in a capture.



Used a conditional filter to locate certain packets in a capture.



# Lab Thoughts & Takeaways
In creating and deploying this lab I learned that WireShark is a very useful tool, in that
