# This Project
This is a instructional step by step process to using the packet capture tool **WireShark** for Defensive Security and Analyzing Network Traffic.

My purpose for this lab is to learn more about Analyzing Network Traffic and Security Monitoring.

# Virtual Machines / Tools
This lab consists of virtual machines created within the Azure Cloud:

  ~ **Ubuntu** ~ This Linux machine will have WireShark installed onto it.
  
  ~ **WireShark** ~ Used to capture packets on a certain interface, then use various filters to observe website traffic.
	
# Network Design

# Lab Creation Steps
Installed and set up Wireshark on Linux.



Captured and saved packets on a detected network using Wireshark.



Used a display filter to observe certain packet protocols.



Employed a display filter to detect a certain IP address in a capture.



Used a conditional filter to locate certain packets in a capture.



# Lab Thoughts & Takeaways
In creating and deploying this lab I learned that Wireshark is a very useful tool, in that
